# Patterns for Decentralised Organising

## 1. Intentionally produce counter-culture
Challenge: 
You want to be non-hierarchical but you have hierarchical habits, e.g.telling people what to do, or looking to others for answers. We are
conditioned by culture
: if there is sexism and racism in your environment,
it can be imprinted into your habits.
Response:
We can 
unlearn hierarchies
 together. We can 
co-design a culture
 that
encourages each of us to develop our best qualities, making us all more
generous, respectful, trusting, courageous, etc.
How do you produce culture? 
Fermentation!
 To make sourdough bread, you
have a 
starter dough
, mixed with 
fresh ingredients, 
and put it somewhere
dark and safe for some time. To ferment a new group culture, your "starter
dough" is a person or people who 
embody some of the qualities
 you want to
develop. The “fresh ingredients” are 
new people
 who have a 
desire
 to grow
in a specific way. We combine these ingredients in a 
retreat
: safe, quiet,
isolated from the outside world for a few days.
Results:
We learn about each other’s 
dreams
 and 
fears
, building deep 
relationships
of trust
 and 
belonging
: the most important resource for all your upcoming
challenges

## 3. Make explicit norms and boundaries
Norms = how we do things around here. 
Boundaries = what we don't do around here. Many groups leave these things unsaid, relying on "common sense".
Challenge: Conflicts grow when people have different unspoken assumptions (everyone has different common sense). When you cross an invisible boundary, it takes huge energy to make the boundary explicit, before you can get to the
behaviour.

Response: **Talk about your norms: 
how do we want to be together?
 e.g. open, honest,
authentic, gentle, inquisitive...
Talk about your boundaries: 
what behaviour do we want to exclude?
 e.g.
no mean feedback, no sexist jokes.
Results:
Buy-in 
— clarity helps people evaluate whether or not they want to be here.
Expectations are clear. There is a process for challenging destructive
behaviour, and a process for updating our agreements.
E.g. see roles + responsibilities described in Enspiral’s People Agreement:
handbook.enspiral.com/agreements/people.html
4. Keep talking about power
Challenge:
Power, influence, status, rank, social capital, volume, access... whatever you
call it, I’ve never met a group where it was equally distributed between all
members. Equality is a compass point to navigate towards, not a destination
I’ve ever arrived at.
Response:
Groups thrive when anyone can safely talk about power differentials.
Imbalance can be bad, e.g. inherited privilege, coercion, manipulation, the
"old boys club". Some imbalance can be good: earned trust, reputation,
eldership.
Transparency reduces toxicity. Discuss together: "
How’s the power?
 Who
has it? How do you earn it?"
Some roles attract power (e.g. manager, facilitator, spokesperson,
coordinator, director). Rotation increases access: take turns, step out,
encourage others to step in.
E.g. Loomio team coordinators are elected by the team for a limited term; we
intentionally support less experienced people to try the role. See
loomio.coop/coordination.html
The best 'elders' use their status to praise, acknowledge, and encourage
people with less.
5. Agree how you’re using your tech
Challenge
Many groups are dissatisfied with their communication technology.
Information overload: too much data but can never find the thing you want.
Half the team uses this tool, the other half uses another one. Too many tools,
don't know how to get everyone's attention, can never find the document I
need.
Response
Agree together what tools are for what job. E.g. the 'trinity of digital comms':
1
. 
Realtime
, like chat, messenger, or Slack. Informal, quick,
organised around 
time
: it's about right now.
2
. 
Asynchronous
, like email, forum or Loomio. More formal,
organised around 
topic
. Has a subject + context + invitation.
Can take days or weeks. Makes a useful archive, considered
comments rather than random messy chatter.
3
. 
Static
, like a wiki, Google Docs, handbook, or FAQ. Very formal,
usually with an explicit process for updating content.
Depending on your work, you will need different tools. The important thing
is that you have an agreement together about what tools are for what job.
With a shared understanding of the tools, they all fit together beautifully.
When people have different ideas, it gets messy.

Introducing a new communications tool usually makes the problem worse.
Most groups don’t know how to introduce new tech well.
This method makes it less likely to go badly:
1
. 
Agree the problem.
 What issue do you want to solve? Do other
team members agree it’s a problem?
2
. 
Volunteer(s) test prototypes.
 One or a few people research
options and come back to the wider group with a
recommendation.
3
. 
Support people to learn.
 Once you’ve chosen a new tool to
evaluate, make space for people to learn together how to use it.
4
. 
Reminders build a habit.
 It can take weeks to develop a new
communication habit. Remind each other gently, "hey we said
we’d try using Loomio for these kinds of conversations..."
5
. 
Evaluate + repeat.
 Most importantly, set a time-limit, e.g.
"We’ll try this tool for 2 months and then evaluate together. Is
the problem solved? Or do we need more training, or a different
tool?"
6. Make decisions asynchronously
Challenge:
Most collaborative groups make decisions in meetings or conference calls. Meetigs
are a kind of 
synchronised
 or 
realtime
 communication: you have to synchronise
people’s calendars to find a time that works, then when they arrive, everyone has to
pay attention to everything at the same time. It’s very 
expensive
, 
excluding
 the
input of people who can’t attend, and often results in 
hurried 
decisions.
Response:
With a little effort, you can develop a habit of 
asynchronous decision-making
.
People can participate in their own time, contributing only to the issues relevant to
them. This is what 
Loomio
 is for: more inclusion and collective intelligence, less
time in meetings.
E.g. I’m on a Board of Directors. We meet monthly. We co-create the agenda in a
Loomio thread ahead of time. A few days before the meeting, a Loomio poll confirms
everyone is happy with the agenda and we’ve all read the reports. We all arrive at the
meeting prepared and focussed. We’ll make some decisions face-to-face. For
decisions that require input from more people, or more time to consider options,
one of the Directors will take the decision to Loomio. We also use the software to
sign off the minutes, and find another meeting time.
Results:
Over time you learn the unique qualities of realtime and async communication.
Meetings are good for bonding, brainstorming, and dealing with complex or
sensitive topics. Loomio creates more space for deliberation: you can take more
time, consider more options, hear from more people, and keep a record.
7. Use rhythm to balance flexibility and focus
Challenge
Hierarchies are designed to manage flows of communication and decision-
making. When you remove the hierarchy, you need to replace it with
something. If there is no agreed structure, your group can suffer from
information overload (everyone asked about everything all the time) and
exclusion (decisions made without appropriate input).
Response
Rhythm helps balance 
speed
 with 
participation.
 People can trust each other
to seek input at the right time, so they don’t need to be involved in every
decision.
We create distinct communication spaces for different timeframes, e.g.
today’s work is discussed 
every morning
; if you want to discuss the long
term strategic direction, we have a dedicated space for that 
every month
.
Example
Here’s a set of working rhythms we use in the Loomio team. You can adapt to
your context, e.g. maybe it makes sense to align with seasons or moon cycles:
Daily
 "standup" meeting. Everyone answers, “What did you do
yesterday? What are you doing today? Are there any obstacles
we can help you with?” Quick info exchange, accountability and
support.
Weekly
 "sprints", a regular working period. E.g. on Monday we
agree what work we’re going to do this week. On Friday we
share progress and have a “retrospective” looking for
