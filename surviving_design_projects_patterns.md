 ## Baby steps 

Introduce small changes into an organization’s culture. Large changes will be met with resistance. Use when: Projects will benefit from new techniques but the organization’s methodology is entrenched.
 
 
 ## Help me prioritize 

Ask the team member to identify which tasks are most important. Use when:   Presented with an unrealistic to-do list and limiting constraints like unreasonable timeframes, incomplete inputs, or a small budget.   
 
 ## Back to basics 

Use fundamental project management techniques (daily status updates via email, granular to-do lists, documenting assumptions, etc.) that may have been absent from the project so far. Use when: Team members are struggling to align their tasks.
 
 
 ## Reduce the assignment 

Give the team member a smaller assignment to ensure that you are both aligned in terms of survivingdesignprojects.tumblr.com/tagged/pattern/page/5 Surviving Design Projects output and objectives.    
 
 ## Ask questions 

When confronted with unreasonable expectations, misguided direction, or harsh critique, use questions to de-escalate the emotion, clarify the intent, and create a sense of alignment. Use when: Colleagues are providing direction or critique without a clear rationale and potentially motivated by some other force–politics, misdirected frustrations, personal problems.   
 
 ## Reasonable expectations 

Be honest with your colleagues about what you can or cannot accomplish given the constraints. Use when: A to-do list materializes with unrealistic deadlines or other constraints attached. See also: Help me prioritize   
 
 ## Prioritize the portfolio 

Think about how a situation or activity will contribute to your “portfolio,” which might encompass more than design solutions. Use when: A situation seems so untenable that you know you won’t have work that reflects your talent or vision. Instead, think about how this work can round out your portfolio with a different kind of story.   
 
 ## Reflection 

Re-state the request or feedback to ensure you understood it correctly. The reflection can take the form of a conversation or written communication. Use when: Historically, you’ve not been aligned with your colleague and have found yourself delivering things that do not meet expectations.   
 
 ## Change the channel 

Use a communications channel that generally makes you uncomfortable, or you have avoided in a particular situation. Use when: You’re not making any headway communicating with team members using existing communication channels.   
 
 ## Help me make this better 

Invite criticism by starting from a position of wanting to improve. Use when: You love your design ideas and are seeking validation instead of input. Setting yourself up for validation will inevitably yield disappointment because you won’t get it. What you will get is criticism, but you may not interpret it constructively if all you’re hoping for is immediate buy-in.    
 
 ## Tell me a story 

Ask people to relate design ideas, accomplishments, or project status in the form of a story. Use when: All the time. People may be able to describe their ideas, but do so without any context or sense of implication. Positioning it as a story forces them to embed rationale and consequences for their design ideas.   
 
 ## Make it real 

Use real examples and be as specific as possible in discussing project plans, scope, or design ideas. Use when: The conversation becomes high level and abstract. Abstractions are easy to throw around, but can be difficult to implement if not supplemented with reality. Considerations: Finding something real can be challenging when stuck in the a conversation about abstractions. Try to zero-in on a specific example of the abstract idea, like a single piece of content, a particular scenario, or the table of contents for a deliverable.   
 
 
 ## Anti-Pattern Being the hero 

Avoid being the person who swoops in and fixes all the problems, or thinking that’s what your job is. Watch for: It’s tempting to be the guy who saves the project, but ultimately no one benefits from this approach. It sets unreasonable expectations, breeds resentment, and creates enormous risk.   
 
 ## Ask for help 

Recognize when you’re in over your head and be prepared to ask for help. Come with recommendations for what would help you the most. Use when: You realize you’re not being effective because you’re constantly encountering obstacles. You anticipate running into problems and know that you won’t be able to handle the tidal wave when it comes.   
 
 ## Convert failure to action 

Use failed approaches to zero-in on the right path. Some situations look like dead-ends: there’s no apparent place to go from here. Colleagues may contribute to this perspective, seeing the latest round of design as complete failure, for example. They’ll throw up their hands and think there’s no way to get back on track. Use these opportunities to ask questions about what isn’t working about the suggested approach. Dissect the failure to understand why it didn’t work and what the right solution would have to do. Dig beneath the surface and see if Use when: Confronted with an apparently hopeless situation.   
 
 ## Logistics specifics 

Do not ask open-ended questions about date, time, location or other logistics. When convening a meeting or conference call, be specific about your preferred times. At the very least, you’ll get agreement. At worst, you’ll be asked to change the time. If you don’t define the details, no one else will. You minimize unhealthy conflict when you don’t give people something to argue about that has no bearing on the success of a project. Setting up a meeting or other activity requiring the coordination of calendars and venues.   
 
 ## Channel your colleagues’ best qualities

When facing a difficult situation, ask yourself “What would X do?” where X is a colleague who brings a unique perspective. By pretending to be one of our colleagues, you can try to take advantage of their strengths in exploring solutions for a difficult challenge. Use when: Your exploration of a situation or challenge hits a roadblock.    
 
 ## Help me help you (The Jerry Maguire) 

Don’t force people to defend their actions: they’ll be unwilling to change their behaviors if put into a defensive posture. Instead, use words to indicate you’ve noticed a challenge and you’d like to provide resources to help. Use when: Colleagues aren’t contributing as expected and you need to raise performance issues with them. Your responsibilities and activities are starting to overlap with other members of the team, who may feel possessive about their tasks.   
 
 ## Anticipate agendas, perspectives, and objectives 

Before attending a meeting, think about the participants and what they want to get out of the conversation. Try to anticipate issues that will be top-of-mind for participants. Also consider situations where participants will want to have something to get off their chest. In such situations, anticipate their need and provide room in the meeting schedule for them to vent. But, enforce the plan to address all the objectives of the meeting. Use when: A meeting you’re organizing will cover a controversial topic.   
 
 ## Good cop, bad cop 

Use a colleague as “bad cop” to deflect the responsibility of making a big decision. Example: Look, if it were up to me, I’d agree to do this for you, but I’ve got to talk to my project lead to make sure she’s OK with my spending the time on it. Use when: Confronted with a question beyond the scope of your responsibility, or with a dramatic impact on the project.   
 
 ## About Patterns 

Patterns have: Description: A short summary of what to do or how to behave. Use When: A list of circumstances in which the pattern be most useful   
 
 ## Pick your battles 

Before confronting someone where you know there will be disagreement, make sure the potential fall-out is worth the effort. Use when: You receive a communication that escalates the conversation in a confrontational way, baiting you into unhealthy conflict.    
 
 ## Capture lessons learned 

Create a repository of lessons learned from project to project to avoid making the same mistakes. Use when: You feel like your project team relies on the same process again and again. # Patterns for Managing Conflict in Creative Workplaces    
 
 ## Offer alternatives 

Prepare several options for moving forward with an easy way to compare and contrast. It’s easier for people to select from a small number of options than it is for them to zero-in on an approach without a starting point. You might want to compare approaches for: Design directions Models for explaining users or site structures Next steps on a project Project plans The important part of offering options is presenting them in parallel for easy comparison. Select key criteria for comparison: you’ll need to anticipate the ways your team wants to choose one and incorporate them prominently in the comparison. Alignment with goals? Cost? Level of effort? Timing? Emphasis on different requirements? Emphasis on user groups? There are any number of ways your options can vary, so make sure they’re easy to compare. Use when: Conflict is caused by ambiguous direction and participants are at a loss for determining appropriate approach.    
 
 ## Treat it like a project 

Apply a project framework to a situation. Looking at the conflict through the rigid structure of a project lens, you can identify what you need to solve the problem. Projects consist of goals, parameters, requirements, activities, and outputs. Defining elements yield schedules and assignments and risks and dependencies. Projects establish a framework for working together. Using a lens to look at a situation in terms of a project means distancing it from other potential influences like politics. Use when: Situations are causing people to behave in an unstructured way, such that their activities don’t clearly align with the project’s objectives. (eg: Researching third-party sources for requirements. The project could be, “What do we need to know about this technology that impacts the design?”) The conflict is not about personality or creative direction, and instead about disparity in priorities. (eg: Getting distracted by a competitor. The project could be, “Does this competitor really matter?”)   
 
 ## Give Negative Feedback Positively 

(via @harvest) I disagree with a few points in this article, but it generally offers some good basic patterns for providing feedback. The article takes a broad position, dealing with all kinds of feedback, but the patterns apply to designers as well. Always start with the positive? The article suggests avoiding starting with positive feedback. I appreciate the position: if the news is bad, give it to me right away. At the same time, designers need to hear what’s working as well as what’s not working about proposed solutions. In incorporating feedback, they want to avoid throwing the baby out with the bathwater. (I’ve done this, and boy was my wife mad.) When it’s hard for me to zero-in on the positives, however, I get the conversation going with this: I see a few things that I like here, but I’m distracted by the position of the buttons. It’s hard to know where to focus my attention. Hurt feelings The article starts off by suggesting that one objective of feedback is to avoid hurt feelings. Managers and colleagues who think they can avoid hurting feelings are fooling themselves. The feelings are the business of the person getting the feedback. That said, effective packaging of feedback can make designers more receptive to the feedback. Poorly packaged feedback will lead to defensiveness, which in turn leads to an unwillingness to respond productively to the feedback.    
 
 ## “Last time we spoke...” 

Gently remind team members about the outcome of previous conversations. Use when: Confronted with a team member with short-term memory loss, and presenting you with conflicting feedback or direction. Considerations: Capture action items and outcomes in real-time for every meeting to ensure YOU don’t suffer from short-term memory loss.   
 
 ## Make assumptions 

Allow yourself to move forward in the design process by making assumptions about missing inputs. Even if you don’t have every requirement captured, every interview complete, or every piece of content inventoried, you can still make progress in solving the design problem. Make some assumptions about the missing inputs, document your assumptions, and prepare a design around them. Discussing the design approach will engage the rest of the team in a dialog about the accuracy of those assumptions. Use when: You can’t get any traction in “discovery” or “strategy” activities, which would normally help you frame the design problem.    
 
 ## Anti-Pattern Playing the victim 

The designer blames everyone but himself for the problems occurring on a project.    
 
 ## What’s your first step? 

Ask colleagues what their immediate activity will be upon receiving a new assignment. Use when: Employing a new methodology or technique, and you’re not sure how your team will proceed. Team members can’t offer specific answers about how they’ll contribute to the overall project or how they’ll address the project’s objectives.    
 
 ## Anti-Pattern Insult colleagues’ intelligence 

By speaking in lofty terms or abstractions, without getting specific to the project or work at hand, you make your colleagues feel dumb. This happens when: You feel defensive about your work. You rely on idealistic methodologies and avoid getting concrete.    
 
 ## Anti-Pattern Black box 

You go off to your desk and work on the solution to a problem, unveiling your work on the deadline itself. You don’t invite critique of the work in progress, ask clarifying questions throughout your process, and get defensive about your methodology.    
 
 ## Come back later 

Don’t respond immediately to a hostile request or insulting communication. Stifle the urge to respond by stepping away from your desk and doing something distracting. Use when: Receiving a message that seems to include counter-productive attacks.    
 
 ## Show your work 

Expose other members of the team to the design process. While designers and other creative people are generally tempted to show only the result of their labor, pulling back the curtain early in the process can be helpful. Besides involving people in the creative process, showing work can help explain the challenges and justify the decisions made. Showing work might entail revealing early sketches or concepts, describing the thought process, or including people in brainstorming, critiques, and other conversations along the way. Use when: Confronting difficult design problems to show how you’ve incorporated and addresses many different inputs or constraints. Working with a team that doesn’t understand the creative process to demonstrate the complexity of the challenge.    
 
 ## Assert your process 

Set the tone, rhythm, and sequence for your process. When embarking on a project, the team may discount the importance of the creative process in problem solving. Other factors — stakeholder schedule and expectations, business milestones, or technical deployment schedules — may influence the approach more than the creative process. Be clear about what the team needs to solve the problem. Use when: Milestones driven by other factors threaten the success of the design project. Team members unwittingly undermine the design process by asserting a cadence or sequence that doesn’t align with your approach to solving the problem.    
 
 ## Sneak peek 

Offer a sneak peek of your work to a lynchpin stakeholder or team member. By holding an informal, one-on-one conversation you can cultivate an ally for subsequent discussions. Incorporating the feedback of a trusted stakeholder creates a sense of ownership, which can help with facilitating large-group discussions. Use when: You’re building toward a potentially controversial or surprising outcome, an inside “ally” can help soften the surprise. Your tasks have taken you out of frequent collaboration with key stakeholders. Use the sneak peek to apprise of progress and keep them involved.    
 
 ## Call the bluff (or Logical conclusions) 

Take a challenge to its inevitable conclusion. For example, when a project manager asks for faster delivery cycles, you can ask whether the stakeholders will be able to assemble their feedback in reasonable time. In these situations, the person making the request does not usually anticipate subsequent impacts of their request. Use when: Faced with a situation which puts unnecessary pressure (usually in quantity of delivery) on the project team.    
 
 ## Small Victory 

Do a small project (a pilot or proof of concept) to help other teams or organizations understand the value or the purpose of a larger program. Like the “Make it Real” pattern, by doing a pilot project, the team has an opportunity to experience the execution of a particular strategy or direction. By implementing at a small scale, the team can extract lessons learned to set them up for a larger endeavor. This small victory serves as a model for subsequent projects. Use when: You’ve identified a strategy or direction, but need to get further buy-in.   
 
 ## Change the metaphor 

Employ a different metaphor for exploring the situation. People typically use war as a metaphor for talking about conflict. Through this metaphor, we come to expect winners and losers, offense and defense, and strategies of shock and awe. The anticipation of conflict, when positioned akin to war, makes it inevitably unproductive. Resolving Conflicts at Work offers two other metaphors: Conflict as opportunity: Position the conflict as a problem that needs solving collaboratively. Conflict as journey: Position the conflict as an ongoing process, allowing you to “transcend the idea that you are trapped in your conflict”. “Journeys create expectations and anticipations of growth, self-improvement, awareness, and forgiveness.” Use when: The language used to describe the conflict is limited to winners/losers and us/them.    
 
 ## Microscope/Macroscope 

Force yourself to look at a situation from both a macro and micro view. It can be hard to consider a situation from multiple perspectives. Through these lenses, however, nuances of the situation reveal themselves. New and different perspective on a situation gives you an opportunity to re-evaluate the conflict, and determine whether the conflict is truly stalling a project. Use when: You’re having trouble seeing the situation from any perspective besides your own.    
 
 ## Pick one thing 

Unpack a conflict by picking one aspect and focusing only on that. Sometimes, conflict is caused because the situation consists of many overlapping aspects. Layered agendas, objectives, problems, and requirements can lead to conflict when team members don’t have clear priorities. By picking one thing to focus on, you can eliminate some of the noise, and use that to drive other problems. Use when: Performance suffers due to lack of focus.    
 
 ## List assumptions 

Create a list of assumptions behind the situation. Sometimes, different people are making different assumptions about responsibilities, parameters, constraints, objectives, or anything driving creative work. Writing a list of assumptions brings them into focus, encourages team members to ask questions, validate the assumptions. Use when: Team members are not performing as expected, delivering work that doesn’t address the problem.    
 
 ## Draw pictures 

Use pictures to communicate situations and solutions. Countless books describe the power of communicating visually, so there’s no need to validate it yet again here. You can use that power to bridge the gap between people who aren’t communicating effectively. Use when you need to: Define the problem Validate constraints or parameters Highlight specific issues Establish a design direction Define a plan or approach Assign responsibilities
