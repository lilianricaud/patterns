# RADICAL OPENNESS

Without perceptibles traces no stigmergy can happen.

therefore, 

Favor openess "a priori" (from the earlier), promote transparency, with large access to information and data.

To provide data that can be reused and allow stigmergy, use FREE LICENCES


---

# FREE LICENCES

When data is locked under standard copyright, it can be reused freely, there's a need of permission. Even when data is freely given, too often it is not explicitly allowing reuse. Moreover when made available, the data can be offered in a format that makes it difficult to reuse. All this creates friction. Agents can't be certain they will be able to perform their action on the long term their effort so this can't allow a sustainable stigmergic process to happen.

Therefore, 

Put all your data under free licences that allow reuse, including commercial. Provide the data in a format that make it easy to reuse (STANDARDS)

# AGENTS

Agents can be individuals or organizations, they describe the individual entities that interact with TRACES and produces ACTIONS.

Locally agents, particularly organization can use CONSENSUS or PYRAMIDAL HIERARCHY .


---

# DIVERSITY

Have a wide and diverse number of agents  

---

# SCALE

large number of AGENTS increase the possibility of interactions and matching between TRACES and ACTIONS.

---

# AFFORDANCE

TRACES must be perceptibles to a degree so that at least some AGENTS can find them and interpret them to produce ACTIONS.

---

# OPEN-ALLOCATION

Have open allocation, AGENTS are autnomous, can choose where and how to work, teams (NODES) emerge.

---

# ORGANIC GROWTH

Close to Alexander's structure-preserving transformation, Hundertwasser's vegetative method.

Allow organic growth of the project with PROJECT dividing/differentiating (DIFFERENTIATION) into NODES as it grows.

This is a step-by-step growth (ITERATIONS) where at each step the current structure is preserved and extended. Reverting back to one step before is easy but it's hard/costly to go back to previous iterations, it's important to make the correct choice at each step or quickly revert

---

# FORKS

Accept and favor forks and development of parallele branches.

keep in mind INTEROPERABILTY AND STANDARDS

---

# CONTROL MECHANISMS


Use  *a posteriori* control mechanisms to ensure the quality of the work, particularly for CRITICAL TASKS

---

# CRITICAL TASKS

Use mechanisms to make sure critical tasks are taken care of.

---

# ITERATIONS

Work iterativelly/step by step/ increase the number of cycles instead of their lenght.

---

# SIMPLE RULES

Have simple rules of interactions



---

# SUPERORDINATE GOAL

The superordinate goal is the social object around which NODES can form.

A super ordinate goal is a way to align easily around a common intent (you either share the intent or not, therefore you follow it or you don't.

---

# ENVIRONMENT

Environment describe the space where interaction between AGENTS occurs. It can be physical or virtual (some authors say MEDIUM).

---

# NODES

Nodes are workgroups where one or more AGENTS gather around some TRACES to produce ACTIONS.

Nodes can break into different BRANCHES/FORKS to go deeper into one TASK or perform the same TASK using two different strategies.

Enfin les noeuds sont les groupes de travail regroupant un nombre plus ou moins grand d’agents autour d’une tache. Un noeud peut se cliver en différentes branches qui, bien que travaillant sur la même tache, utilisent deux approches différentes en parallèle.

# LEAVE A TRAIL 

Eugene Kim: "I’ve called this pattern THINK OUT LOUD and Visible Pulse in the past, but I like “Leave A Trail” better, because of its association with stigmergy".

The idea is simple. When you work, leave an artifact somewhere where others can find it. An artifact
doesn’t have to be comprehensive; in fact, it’s often better when it isn’t. A brief meeting summary is
usually more useful than a full transcript. A brief summary with links to specific instances in the
transcript is even more useful. 

When you Leave A Trail, you’re communicating to whomever wants to listen, which may effect how you express yourself. This can be disconcerting to some. People often point to the lack of response as a sign that tools like online forums, blogs, or Wikis aren’t working. That’s not necessarily the case.
 
There may be a whole slew of lurkers who are reacting to the signs that you are leaving. (That said, Immediate Feedback is also an important pattern in Online Communities.)

This can also be difficult when determining what kind of trail to leave. Because you don’t know who
will be reacting to your signs, you can’t target them. The solution is to Scratch Your Own Itch.

Emergence can’t happen without Leave A Trail. However, Leave A Trail is just one of many conditions
for emergence. You can’t dictate whether emergence will happen, and when it does, you can’t control
what actually emerges. 

The best you can do is create conditions for emergence and hope that good things happen. This is disconcerting to many, and folks often react by trying to assert more control, which makes things worse.

Leave A Trail and other principles are helpful in designing community spaces. For example, if you are
trying to integrate blogs or Wikis into a community’s practice, the best way to do that is to apply the tool in such a way that it scratches an individual’s itch while also leaving a trail. 

For example, many good project leaders are good at doing meeting summaries. Instead of having them email a small subset of individuals, have them email a public, archived mailing list. Better yet, have them blog their summaries and email links to the blog. You’re not significantly changing individual behavior in these situations, but you are significantly improving your chances for large-scale collaboration.
