Much of the organisational structure is borrowed from the American and Spanish movements: Committees of 30 to 100 people each direct the movement’s communication, logistics, security and entertainment.

## GENERAL ASSEMBLIES
Major decisions are made at a “general assembly” where anyone can put their name on a list to speak. People show approval by waving, and votes are decided by a simple show of hands. 

General Assemblies sometimes use mechanisme fo favor public expression of  women and underrepresented minority groups

## HAND SIGNALS
The Occupy movement hand signals are a group of hand signals used by Occupy Wall Street protesters to negotiate a consensus. Hand signals are used instead of conventional audible signals, like applause, shouts, or booing, because they do not interrupt the speaker.

"We'll be in april when we decide it" said some signs written by 
#NuitDebout participants. They decided change the dates to march 32nd, 33rd, 34th…  demonstrating the people can change the rules if they want to. this is similar to Transition network in Totden printing 21£ notes of local money, saying " we can, so why not?"
