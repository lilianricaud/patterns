# CARDS MANAGEMENT PATTERNS


## Index Card
An index card (also called a SystemCard) is a small rectangular piece of thin cardboard or thick paper, suitable for writing on, frequently ruled on one side or both. Popular sizes in North America include 3x5" (76x127mm) and 4x6" (102x152mm). In countries where metric paper is used (Germany in this case) probably the most common size is A7 (74x105mm), smaller ones (A8 = 52x74mm) are also used, as are bigger ones like A6 (105x148mm) or A5 (148x210mm).

Index cards can be used for many things:

    used in a PersonalAnalogDevice.
    used as CrcCards
    used as a DataBase http://www.absolutewrite.com/novels/index_cards.htm
    used for project management. The logistics for the Gulf War were managed on index cards. Read "Moving Mountains" by Lt. General George Pagonis.
    used as StoryCards

## COLOURS

In college I used cards to organize concepts for a particularly difficult paper. I tried colored cards (not enough colors) and dots on the cards (not easily categorized in a deck). I solved this by using colored markers, and coloring the top-right corner (about a 1cm x 1cm triangle), INCLUDING the card edge. You get as many colors as you want, plus you can see the colored corner when the cards are in a stack.

## CARDS RACK

Suppose you have a bunch of 3 x 5 (inch) cards that you want to 
 organize on a wall or similar vertical surface....


 Get a large piece of strong paper-like material. Make alternate 
 valley and mountain folds across the paper.  Make the mountain 
 folds 1 inch below the valley folds; the valley folds 2 inches below 
 the mountain folds. When you have finished folding, the paper 
 should appear pleated. Bind the edges with tape.


 Fasten to the wall. Stick your cards in the pockets. 


 A large Federal Express envelope is a good source of material for a 
 small rack. If you want to do an entire wall, try Dupont Tyvek 
 House Wrap. Buy it at Home Depot. It's similar to the FedEx 
 envelope material.


 I haven't made a large rack like this but I do have a couple of small 
 ones. I also have a one pocket version taped to the top of my 
 monitor to hold cards for immediate work in progress.
