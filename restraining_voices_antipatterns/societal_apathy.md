# Societal Apathy

Societal Apathy is a collective indifference toward issues of concern. A society that issocially apathetic towards its own sense of purpose might lack the civic intelligence to overcome adversities it encounters. Another form is directed outward upon groups of people so as to ignore their situation by seeing thetroubles that they face as eternal, unchangeable,and ultimately not worth thinking about.
