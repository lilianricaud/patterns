# Monopoly

Monopolies exist when one institution (or a small number of institutions) control all access to something, generally a commodity,information, or a service. In the absence of external controls, the monopolist institution can (and almost inevitably does) make up the rules all by themselves, and rarely to the benefit of the many.
