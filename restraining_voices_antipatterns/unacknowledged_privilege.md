# Unacknowledged Privilege

Although privilege is rampant in virtually any society, it’s generally the best-kept non secret. Suggesting that others have it suggests that you are just unhappy you don’t have it. Acknowledging it in yourself suggests that you don’t really deserve the position you’re in. Unacknowledged privilege can not only help you into areas that you might not be otherwise qualified for, but can buy you out of negative consequences that you might otherwise have toface.
