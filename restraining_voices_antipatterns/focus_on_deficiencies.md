# Focus on Deficiencies

This pattern suggests that the way that people indominant positions look at a community, school,country, etc. is to focus on its deficiencies; what's broken or dysfunctional. Thus, one can "diagnose" a community for its "diseases" suchas crime, drug use, broken families, or "loose morals."
