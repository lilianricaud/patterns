# Activism Delegitimization 

Dissenters, especially those who are active in their dissent can be delegitimized in order to take away their ability to be taken seriously by the public. This is very effective when done thru mass media outlets. One very effective form of delegitimization is ridicule because it spread seasily and avoids actually examining the situation.
