# Compartmentalized Knowledge 

Knowledge is effectively compartmentalized (orput into "compartments") when different people not only have access to certain types ofknowledge but are actually denied formally or via social norms or personal preferences from going beyond their allowable sphere. Academics often do this to draw boundaries around their own disciplines, thus preventing perceived encroachment and interdisciplinary research.
