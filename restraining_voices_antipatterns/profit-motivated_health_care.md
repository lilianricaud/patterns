# Profit-motivated Health Care

Pharmaceutical and health insurance companies profit off of disease and injury, and so it is in their fiscal interest to keep patients ill and/or injured. Band-aid "solutions" and expensive procedures target symptoms, instead than causes of diseases in this pattern. Health through prevention should be studiously avoided as it leads to “prevention” in profits as well.
