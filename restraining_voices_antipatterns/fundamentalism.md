# Fundamentalism

Fundamentalism is a term for a range of rigid and extreme beliefs. Fundamentalism is found all over the world. It’s often religious when one group’s gods and laws are absolutely true and all others are absolutely false. Some typical characteristics are: exclusionism, strict adherence to certain doctrines, an acceptance of violence, xenophobia, and a belief in the end of the world. Fundamentalism — and not just the religious kind — is fundamental for perpetuating
worldwide turmoil.
