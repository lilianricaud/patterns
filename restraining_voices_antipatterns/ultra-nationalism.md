# Ultra-nationalism

This is the belief that your country of choice is bar none, hands down, the best country in the world. No other country comes close and your countries interests are more important that all other countries interests...combined. Without the VIOLENCE and intimidation that accompanies this anti-pattern, the people and groups who employ would seem a lot more humorous.
