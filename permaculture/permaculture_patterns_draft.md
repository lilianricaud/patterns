In this document, we try to examine and rewritte permaculture principles as patterns. The first step is to identify CENTERS, ie the chunks and try to write them in the pattern format, examine their relative links (SYSTEM HIERARCHY), combine, differentiate or delete some of them. Re-examine, rewritte, and iterate...

 Work in progress.


## MOLLISON PRINCIPLES

1. Everything works both ways – see the duality in things; positive & negative 
2. Everything works in many ways - diversity of functions, yields, relationships 
3. See solutions not problems – look for opportunities / re-adjust relationships 
4. To co-operate and not compete – this applies to natural and human systems and relationships between different elements
5. To make things pay - i.e. everything contributes to something else - “there’s no such thing as a free lunch” 
6. To work where it counts - minimum input for maximum benefit 
7. To use everything to its highest capacity
8. To bring food production back to the cities 
9. To help make people self-reliant - individuals & communities 
10. To minimize maintenance and energy input while maximizing yield

Principles – Mollison & Slay, Introduction to Permaculture (1991) These are expressed more in terms of strategies and methodologies 
•  
• 
• Each important function is supported by many elements
• Efficient energy planning (e.g. zone & sector planning) 



### Energy cycling 

### Small-scale intensive systems

### Plant stacking 
• Accelerating succession and evolution 

### Diversity 

### Guilds 

### Edge effect

Additional concepts and definitions of Permaculture Principles (from http://www.thefarm.org/permaculture/)

### ETHICS
Often the means and the end are confused. It is ok to use evil means to reach "good" goals. Yet most often this is distastrous. Therefore, to ensure sustainability and social fairness use ETHICS. Keep it simple enough for everyone to understand, and put if before anything else 

Permaculture is science based on an ethics: Care for the earth, care for the people, fairshare.

### RELATIVE LOCATION
Relative Location – pattern relationships
Relative Location Components placed in a system are viewed relatively, not in isolation.

### FUNCTIONNAL RELATIONSHIP
Functional Relationship between components.
Everything is connected to everything else Recognize functional relationships between elements.

### MULTIFUNCTIONNALITY
Each element performs many functions 

Every element is supported by many functions Each element we include is a system, chosen and placed so that it performs as many functions as possible (RELATIVE LOCATION).

### (FUNCTIONAL) REDUNDANCY
Every function is supported by many elements - Redundancy Good design ensures that all important functions can withstand the failure of one or more element.



### LOCAL FOCUS

Local Focus "Think globally - Act locally" Grow your own food, cooperate with neighbors. 

### COMMUNITY EFFICIENCY

Community efficiency not self-sufficiency.


### INTERACTIVE DIVERSITY

Diversity As a general rule, as sustainable systems mature they become increasingly diverse in both space and time. What is important is the complexity of the functional relationships that exist between elements not the number of elements.

### BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

Biological Resources We know living things reproduce and build up their availability over time, assisted by their interaction with other compatible elements. Use and reserve biological intelligence.

### ONE CALORIE IN / ONE CALORIE OUT

One Calorie In/One Calorie Out Do not consume or export more biomass than carbon fixed by the solar budget.

### BALANCE

Stocking Finding the balance of various elements to keep one from overpowering another over time. How much of an element needs to be produced in order to fulfill the need of whole system?

### STACKING

Stacking Multi-level functions for single element (stacking functions). Multi- level garden design, ie., trellising, forest garden, vines, groundcovers, etc.

### SUCCESSION

Succession Recognize that certain elements prepare the way for system to supports other elements in the future, i.e.: succession planting.

### ONSITE RESOURCES

Use Onsite Resources Determine what resources are available and entering the system on their own and maximize their use.

### EDGE EFFECTS

Edge Effect Ecotones are the most diverse and fertile area in a system. Two ecosystems come together to form a third which has more diversity than either of the other two, i.e.: edges of ponds, forests, meadows, currents etc.

### ENERGY RECYCLING

Energy Recycling Yields from system designed to supply onsite needs and/or needs of local region.
Small Scale Intensive Systems start small and create a system that is managable and produces a high yield.

### SMALLEST CHANGE

Make Least Change for the Greatest Effect The less change that is generated, the less embedded energy is used to endow the system.

### PLANTING STRATEGY

Planting Strategy 1st-natives, 2nd-proven exotics, 3rd unproven exotics - carefully on small scale with lots of observation.

### NATURAL CYCLES

Work Within Nature Aiding the natural cycles results in higher yield and less work. A little support goes along way. -> SUCCESSION

### APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY

Appropriate Technology The same principles apply to cooking, lighting, transportation, heating, sewage treatment, water and other utilities.

### Law of Return 

Whatever we take, we must return Every object must responsibly provide for its replacement.

### Stress and Harmony / SYSTEMIC ORDER

Stress here may be defined as either prevention of natural function, or of forced function. Harmony may be defined as the integration of chosen and natural functions, and the easy supply of essential needs.

Principle of Disorder Order and harmony produce energy for other uses. Disorder consumes energy to no useful end. Tidiness is maintained disorder.
Chaos Has form, but is not predictable. The amplification of small fluctuations. Entropy In complex systems disorder is an increasing result. Entropy and lifeforce are a stable pair that maintain the universe to infinity.
Metastability For a complex system to remain stable, there must be small pockets of disorder.
Entelechy Principal of genetic intelligence. i.e. The rose has thorns to protect itself.
Observation Protracted & thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor.


### The Problem is the solution 

We are the problem, we are the solution. Turn constraints into resources
Mistakes are tools for learning

### System's yield

The yield of a system is theoretically unlimited The only limit on the number of uses of a resource possible is the limit of information and imagination of designer.
Dispersal of Yield Over Time Principal of seven generations. We can use energy to construct these systems, providing that in their lifetime, they store or conserve more energy that we use to construct them or to maintain them.

A Policy of Responsibility (to relinquish power) The role of successful design is to create a self-managed system.


### NATURAL AND LANDUSE CATCHMENT 

(map structure / location )
Biome, climate, geology & landform, ecosystems, biodiversity, watersheds, landuse patterns, forestry, fisheries, agriculture, extractive resources, national parkes & nature reserves, natural hazards (fire, flood, cyclone etc) Identify information resources, authorities, professional & community groups relating to the above. Establish advantages, constraints, challenges and opportunities.

### SOCIAL CATCHMENT 

Identify areas & nodes based on social patterns, where & how people meet their needs- material, social cultural & economic, and settlement patterns including shopping, industry, education, recreation, entertainment, community organizations and networks, communications, demographics, history, community values, potential, challenges, conflict, opportunities. Explore interplay between social & services catchment overlays for strategic planning & community developmt.

### SERVICES CATCHMENT 

Identify networks, hierarchy & thresholds of utility & administrative services. Infrastructure & transport including all govt levels, industry & community-based organizations. Elements include: roads & transport networks, electricity grid, renewable energy sources, waste & recycling, communications, local government boundaries, State & fed electorates, regional governmt offices, agencies & services. Identify constraints and opportunities.

### BIOREGIONAL RESOURCE AUDIT

- what comes into/ is imported into area? 
- what leaves/ is exported from area? 
- what is the local impact resulting from the above? 
• identify 'leaks' and priorities for action/ consolidation 
- which imports can be locally produced? 
- which 'leaks'/ exports can be recycled within the area?
- which wastes accumulates (unsused resources) where could they be used ?

Build on what exists – don’t duplicate or re-invent the wheel.
Check out what other groups are doing in the same area/field for ideas & inspiration (benchmarking)

### DESIGN FRAMEWORK / Design principles


### FEED THE SOIL

Some key concepts in permaculture and how do they apply in group collaboration ?

Can I compare water and information ?

plants/organisation

When add chemicals you get a fast unnatural growth but this create a dependance and a weakness of the element that is articially stimulated.

In permaculture we feed the soil, not the plant. If the soil is good, the plants will grow. 

In social permaculture, we should focus on designing an healthy environment to allow existing individuals and structures to grow naturally at their own pace and grow their strength.
Money is like chemical fertilizer. 
When growing a project whether research projects within the research community or local economy in crisis environment, we should focus on developping a healthy environment that can allow emergence of projects.


### SOCIAL PERMACULTURE

As human we are individually intelligent but often collectivelly stupid (exception of local tribes or village that use to or still live harmoniously with their environment).

Multicellular organisms like plants or animal are harmonious because cells communicate and cooperate efficiently.

On the other hand in moderne societies we are more like bacteria, with each individual eating and shitting in the environment. so we basically are eating everything we have (our available resources), and dying in our own waste from starvation and our pollution.

How can we design systems that favor group collaboration and collective intelligence rather than colective studpidity?

Can we develop a robust method to understanding a group, its strenghts, weakness, build functional interconnections to get a productive collaborative environment ?

permaculture is a powerfull conceptual framework and an emerging design system rather than any specific technical or behavioural solution.

Solution oriented and positivistic.

Change the way we work: From competition to collaboration

DESIGN METHOD

NEEDS

MAPS/use mind maps ? or layered ppt/psd ?

do real tests with blueFROG/construire online/IME Mathalin

FUNCTION MAP (ex accounting, marketing, production, bar, guest relationship)
ELEMENTS MAP:
PEOPLE MAP: people, job list, other interests or qualities
TECHNOLOGY MAP: information system, tools, computers, …
STRUCTURE: building, rooms, desk, map include quality or disturbances (noise, natural light, access …)
INFORMATION FLOWS
WORKFLOWS

How do I map electronic relationship (skype, chat ?)

(bioregion Warren Notes)

Mainframe design
Structure = information system
Access = ergonomy
Water = map and optimise the information flux

One element performs several functions: one person performs several jobs, stimulation by novelty, continous reassesment of one abilities. People have to see the work from other people eyes (the restaurant manager has to see it like the guest, the boss like the employee)

Important function are backed up by several elements. Decision making process, signing of checks or spending up to a certain amount can be made by several person and or locally to prevent blocage if the decision maker is not present.
